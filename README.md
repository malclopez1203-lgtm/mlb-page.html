<h2>Team History & Highlights</h2>
<p>The Orlando Thunderhawks were founded in 1995 as an expansion franchise in the American League East. Their inaugural seasons focused on player development and scouting, building a competitive roster from young prospects and experienced veterans. By 1998, Orlando had captured its first AL East title and won the World Series, beginning a dynasty that would span several decades. The team is known for innovative use of analytics, clutch hitting, and strategic depth in pitching and defense. Over the years, Orlando has won 12 World Series championships, 14 American League pennants, and at least 15 AL East division titles.</p>

<p>During the 1990s and early 2000s, Orlando dominated the league with consecutive playoff appearances and multiple championships. The second dynasty in 2008–2010 featured rising stars and veteran leadership, while the third dynasty (2016–2018) relied on elite pitching and young offensive power. The current era, 2020–2026, has solidified Orlando as the most dominant franchise of the modern MLB era, setting records in wins, ERA, home runs, and fan engagement.</p>
